# There is no control from the surface, everything is automatic. Fucking deal with it
# Step 1: Turn the TX2 and PI on and make sure to update the IP in the configs folder
# Step 2: SSH into both the PI and TX2 in two seperate terminal windows
# Step 3: run the following command: `./runme.sh` on the TX2 first then the PI 
# Note: If you do it out of order and then yell at me be ready
# Step 4: Do whatever you need to do, like more coffee or me right now which is more weed

# I have plans to fix the surface side of things so you can send data between the surface and pi and then transmit the controls to the TX2 from the pi but i havent gotten there yet. (i have 7 assignments due tonight that i havent started)
# If shit doesnt work you should get an error but its probably not from my side since i didnt get any yet
